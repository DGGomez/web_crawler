 # Focused Web Crawler

 #Web Crawler searches for 
 
 workout information

 #you need to explain the stop criteria you use to stop the crawling process, 

After K sites over a certain threshold of similarity to original docs it stops.
 
#how you follow the Robots Exclusion Protocol, 

I go to the robot.txt url and take all the disallowed urls and put them on a don't visit array which stops reading on those URLS
 
#how you follow the politeness policy (e.g. time gap between requests to the same site), 
 
10 second time delay between each website check. Added header information for web crawler

#the size of the crawled set of documents (in terms of the number of documents and the total number of bytes), 
 
212 websites, average 83 kb each (based on the content string sizes in result file)

#the time your program takes to complete the crawling process.

Average time 14.5 minutes
